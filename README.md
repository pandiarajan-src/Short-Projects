# Short-Projects
The main intention of this repository is to store some of the short projects that I work by learning from others.

## 1. Build Systems using ChatGPT

This is a project that I have learnt from [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai) course ["Build System with the ChatGPT API"](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/building-systems-with-chatgpt/)<br>
It's a great start to learn on how to use OpenAI APIs.

#### Credits
It was taught by [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org) and [Isha Fulford](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~137229549) who collaborated with [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai) to create the "Build System with the ChatGPT API" course.<br> and all credits goes to them.

## 2. Prompt Engineering using ChatGPT

This is a project that I have learnt from [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai) course ["ChatGPT Prompte Engineering for Developers"](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/chatgpt-prompt-eng/lesson/4/summarizing/)<br>
It's a great start to learn on how to work with Prompts using OpenAI APIs.
